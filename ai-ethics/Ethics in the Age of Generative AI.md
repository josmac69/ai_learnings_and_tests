# Ethics in the Age of Generative AI

**Generative AI and Ethics - the Urgency of Now**
- AI has the potential to accelerate human inspiration, creativity, and promote equity in the world.
- Ethics in AI is a human function, not an AI function.
- The decisions we make today will shape the future of AI for decades.

**Distinguishing responsible tech from human behavior**
- Generative AI is transforming every aspect of human experience, including banking, agriculture, and human resources.
- Ethical design is crucial to prevent AI from perpetuating bias, making the world more unequal, and doing so in ways that are invisible to us.
- Ethical concerns include deep fakes, chatbots giving false advice, and questions of legal and copyright ownership of ideas and products created by generative AI.

**Understanding Vilas' ethical AI framework**
- The three pillars of ethical AI are responsible data practices, well-defined boundaries on safe and appropriate use, and robust transparency.
- Responsible data practices involve reducing explicit and implicit bias in the training data.
- Well-defined boundaries involve creating a focused statement of intention about the organization's goals and identifying the population they're trying to serve.
- Robust transparency involves making the recommendations of the tool transparent and traceable for human auditing of ethical accountability.

**Applying Vilas' framework in a real world situation**
- The case study of a company's AI-driven chatbot making inappropriate responses to customers highlights the importance of ethical decision making.
- The company's CTO, Sarah, takes the chatbot offline and starts with data, directing her team to use a new, scrubbed dataset and run the model through bias detection processes and filters.
- Sarah realizes the chatbot is being used for non-business conversations, so she limits the chatbot's discussion topics and tailors responses to the chatbot's specific expertise.
- Sarah also realizes the need for better traceability and evaluation of the tool's outputs, so she encourages the creation of an internal audit process and a risk assessment and response framework.
- The case study emphasizes that ethical analysis needs to be intertwined with the initial design of new products and at every phase of deployment.

**Organizing data with ethics in mind**
1. AI models are built on data, so it's crucial to ethically organize and use your institution's data.
2. Three goals in ethical data organization: prioritizing privacy, reducing bias, and promoting transparency.
3. Conduct privacy audits to understand what data your organization has, how it was collected, stored, and administered.
4. Train employees on handling sensitive data securely.
5. Conduct bias audits to ensure the data represents the population you're serving.
6. Transparency is vital. Explain to all stakeholders how data is collected and used.

**Preparing technology teams to make ethical decisions**
1. Technology teams face unique challenges in ethical decision making due to their specific skills, fast pace, and regulatory requirements.
2. Ethical decisions include ensuring data security and privacy, auditing algorithms for fairness, and understanding the environmental impact of their decisions.
3. Foster a culture of ethical decision making within the team.
4. Establish a technology-specific training curriculum focusing on emerging technologies and ethical challenges.
5. Consider ethical challenges at the start of every project.

**Preparing C-Suite in directing responsible AI**
1. C-Suite plays a critical role in building cultures of responsible AI.
2. Establish a responsible AI policy and governance framework.
3. Provide AI training and education for every person in the organization.
4. Insist on building ethical AI elements into all technologies and conduct regular audits.
5. Consider hiring a chief AI ethics officer.

**Preparing the Board of Directors to manage risk and opportunity in AI**
1. Board directors have a legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interest of an organization and its stakeholders.
2. Ensure the organization has policies and procedures in place to identify and address ethical concerns.
3. Establish a dedicated AI committee to oversee ethical AI practices within the organization.

**Consulting your customers in building AI**
1. Understand and incorporate customer preferences, needs, and wants into product design.
2. Use the LISA framework: Listen to users, Involve customers in design decisions, Share simple and transparent privacy policies, and Audit your work.
3. Include users from diverse backgrounds and experiences to get a wider range of perspectives.

**Communicating effectively organizationally and globally**
1. Coordinate different stakeholders to create new spaces and forums for groups to come together.
2. Establish new mechanisms of clear communication between stakeholders.
3. Develop training programs to educate employees and stakeholders about ethical considerations in AI.
4. Develop a system for collecting and addressing user-feedback.
5. Engage formally and informally with external stakeholders to ensure considering the broadest possible implications of AI.

**Setting an intention of continual questioning**
1. Find innovative ways to incorporate communities in what you're building.
2. Focus on building skills beyond technology.
3. Make an intention in your daily work to become a steward of a human-centered future.
